# Breakable Bones REBORN

The original Breakable Bones mod by JoeSwan#2228, reborn and working out of the box! Based on CombatPlus's neck snapping but applied to every limb and configurable.

## Why did you remake this mod?

The original mod has weak default values for the force and torque limits causing NPCs that are spawned with it to just collapse like a house of cards. This mod has some recommended settings I found on reddit that work well for me. JoeSwan's mod also doesn't seem to include any default sound effects so I added some.

## How do i use this?

Everything should work out of the box, but you can configure the settings in either the configuration file in .\UserData\BreakableBonesReborn\breakable.cfg or through the BoneMenu. If you want to modify or add more sound effects just change the files in .\UserData\BreakableBonesReborn\bonebreaks, or add your own!
